HI Everyone!
I have build this application called "Family Travel Tracker". what it does is that you can add the country you have been visited, by typing the name of country it will show the country on the map.

the amazing thing is that you can add the family membares by clicking on "Add Family Membare", it will show you the form to add new membare and select the color, and that membare can also add the countries that he or she has been visited.
